# Introduction
I recently discovered that footnotes in ebooks, when formatted correctly, can be displayed at the bottom of the page, and not at the end of the book (if the ereader supports it).

However, most ebooks are not formatted correctly; books must be EPUB version 3 for this to work, and even then, they are frequently formatted free from conformity.

Following the accessibility guidelines laid out by the [DAISY Consortium](https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/notes.html) (the official accessibility source for the W3C EPUB standard), the aim is to identify footnotes that are not formatted correctly and correct their formatting.
